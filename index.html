    <h3>ONLINE LEARNING</h3>
    
<p>Learning new academic material online is probably a new experience for you. I know that teaching it entirely online is new for me. With that said, here are my current hopes and expectations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, take a deep breath. There is a lot being asked of you right now. I hope to stay considerate of that as I make my plans. </li>
  <li>If at any time you feel overwhelmed, or if circumstances arise which prevent you from staying with the material, please let me know. I plan to respond with flexibility and grace.</li>
  <li>Please check your 4J (Zimbra) e-mail on a daily basis. This will be one of my main ways to get in touch with you. Please join Remind if you can. </li>
  <li>Please send me a quick text (via Remind) or an e-mail when you encounter any problems, whether they be academic or technical. I will get back to you ASAP and we can make arrangements to chat online (if needed) or otherwise get you the help you need. </li>
</ul>
<!--<p>I plan to be ONLINE and AVAILABLE to respond to you during these times: Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 10am-12pm, and 1pm-2pm. Outside of those hours I may not be able to respond to you as quickly. E-mail sent to me outside of those hours may not reach me until the next time I check it (which is guaranteed during those hours).</p>
I am currently planning on three assignments per week, not to exceed an expected three hours of work. Each assignment may consist of some reading, a video, and a problem exercise. The week’s assignments will be due on the Friday of that week by 5pm. There will be one short quiz (open note) every week on the current material. 
Due to the online nature of this all, I will not be able to accept late work unless you have previously arranged it with me because there is a compelling reason. Keeping track of online submitted work is difficult, but I know that we all may have extenuating circumstances so I would like to be flexible if something comes up that means you cannot turn in something on time.
Assignments may be delivered via video, website, Khan Academy lessons & quizzes,  or Desmos activity.
I am learning how to best do this just like you are. I am open to your feedback. I may need to revise my approach, but if I need to do so I will communicate this to you to the best of my ability!

Online Expectations for Students
Students must understand and agree to the following regarding the use of online meeting platforms for official school communication.
The meeting links you receive from a teacher are for you and you only. You are not to share the link with others outside of your class or try to attend meetings that are not for you.
There will likely be a waiting room before entering a regular meeting. Please wait patiently until you are admitted to the conversation. Students who are disruptive may be sent back to the waiting room.  Just like in regular class, this takes time away from the experience of the other learners and the teacher.
Students must not play with virtual backgrounds or other special effects during online conversations unless given special permission by the teacher.
Use your real name, not a code name or abbreviation or something humorous.
If you turn your video off, just leave the screen blank with your name, no picture substitutions.
In conversations with 5 or more people:
Automatically mute yourself except when it’s your turn to speak in any meeting.
Use the “hand raise” feature to indicate you want to speak.
Private chats are not allowed during school online conversations.
Remember that this is for school purposes. When participating in an online meeting for school, bring your classroom behavior to the screen.
Locate yourself in an appropriate place.
Sit (or stand) as you would in class.
Wear school appropriate attire.
Remove other distractions and focus solely on the online conversation.
You may not take pictures, screenshots, or videos of the online conversation, without express permission.-->
